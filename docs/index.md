## Why OpenBubi?

OpenBubi is a really nice solution, and it is easy to integrate. OpenBubi has really nice feautures, like checking the type of the parameters (in Python), and having asynchronous methods (in Dart). Those features are making OpenBubi really good.

There are some use cases:

1. You can make a smart-watch app, that can be used to rent bikes
2. You can redesign the MOL Bubi web app
3. You can make a data analyzing algorithm for MOL Bubi routes (a couple of Hungarians have [already done this](https://dms.sztaki.hu/bubi/), but they would have had an easier time with OpenBubi :D)
4. You can make a smart assistant that can calculate the path to the nearest MOL Bubi station, and then rent a bike on that station.
5. You can make a MOL Bubi client with a TUI (Text User Interface), or a CLI (Command Line Interface)
