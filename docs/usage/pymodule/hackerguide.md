# <p align="center">Using for brute force attacks</p>

## What are we going to do?

We are going to make an algorithm, that tries to login to a MOL Bubi account with every 6-digit password

## Write the program

First of all, make a new Python script in the cloned folder

```bash
mkdir bubiforce && touch bubiforce/bruteforce.py
```

Then import all the necessary modules in the newly created program/script

```python
import sys # for path manipulation
sys.path.append("../") # add openbubi.py's folder to the current path
import openbubi
```

Then make a `for` cycle, that iterates over the set of six-digit numbers

```python

```
