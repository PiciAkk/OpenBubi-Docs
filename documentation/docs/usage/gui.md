# <p align="center">Try it out using a fancy GUI</p>

*Note: On Ubuntu, you can get a dependency error, (about `tkinter`) when you're trying to run the GUI. If this is the case, run `make`, or (manually) `sudo apt install python3-tk`. (I don't know if this error is present in other distros -> try it for yourself, and maybe start a Pull Request about it)*

- Start the GUI
```bash
python ./gui/login.py
```
- Enter your MOL Bubi credentials
- Enjoy the experience :D
